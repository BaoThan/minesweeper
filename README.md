## Overview

This is a React-based implementation of the classic Minesweeper game. The application is structured as a typical React project, with components, styles, and configuration files.

## Key Components

### App.jsx
The main application component that likely renders the game board and manages overall game state.

### Board.js  
Renders the game board grid of cells.

### Cell.js
Represents an individual cell on the game board.

### Minesweeper.js
Core game logic for Minesweeper gameplay.

### GameState.js
Manages the overall game state (e.g. in progress, won, lost).

### Header.js
Renders the header/title area of the game.

### GameOver.js
Displays game over screen when the game ends.

### DropDown.js
Likely provides difficulty selection options.

### Faces.js
Renders smiley face icons to indicate game state.

## Styles

Styling is handled through CSS files:
- App.css
- index.css

## Configuration

- package.json - Defines project dependencies and scripts
- .gitignore - Specifies files to ignore in version control
- public/manifest.json - Web app manifest file

## Build and Development

- Uses Create React App build tooling
- npm scripts defined for starting dev server, building, etc.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
3. Use `npm start` to run the development server
4. Play Minesweeper in your browser!

The game likely allows selecting difficulty, clicking cells to reveal them, and implements standard Minesweeper rules and gameplay.
